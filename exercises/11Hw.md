## Task 1: Lambda-lifting and defunctionalization

Following examples in the [lecture](https://ps-tuebingen-courses.github.io/pl1-lecture-notes/24-defunctionalization/defunctionalization.html),
apply lambda-lifting and defunctionalization to the following code samples (in increasing order of difficulty).

1.

```scala
def map(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => Int): List[Int] = xs match {
  case Nil     => Nil
  case x :: xs => f(x) :: map(xs)(f)
}

def caller1(l: List[Int]): List[Int] =
  map(l)(x => x + 1) ++
    map(List(1, 2, 3))(x => x + 2)
```

2. (Hint: If there are functions with different types, you can use one separate
    ADT for each type, or you can use a type parameter as done in the lecture.)

```scala
def map(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => Int): List[Int] = xs match {
  case Nil     => Nil
  case x :: xs => f(x) :: map(xs)(f)
}

def flatMap(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => List[Int]): List[Int] = xs match {
  case Nil     => Nil
  case x :: xs => f(x) ++ flatMap(xs)(f)
}

def caller2(l: List[Int]): List[Int] =
  flatMap(List(1, 2, 3))(x => map(List(x + 1))(y => x + y))
```

3. (Hint: Note that there is also a first-class function in `map2`, not just in `caller3`.)

```scala
def flatMap(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => List[Int]): List[Int] = xs match {
  case Nil     => Nil
  case x :: xs => f(x) ++ flatMap(xs)(f)
}

def map2(xs: List[Int])(f: Int => Int): List[Int] = flatMap(xs) { x =>
  List(f(x))
}

def caller3(l: List[Int]): List[Int] =
  flatMap(List(1, 2, 3))(x => map2(List(x * 3))(y => x + y + 42))
```
