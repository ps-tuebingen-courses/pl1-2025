# Homework 12

This is the final homework.

## Task 1: STLC

1. Typecheck by hand the [STLC](https://ps-tuebingen-courses.github.io/pl1-lecture-notes/26-stlc/stlc.html)
   expressions in the following subtasks (in the
   empty context, unless otherwise specified). For each expression, you only
   need to write whether it is type-correct and if so, which is its overall type.
2. Try to predict whether the corresponding Scala versions (copied below) are
   going to typecheck, based on the typechecking behavior of the STLC version.
3. You can check your answers using the actual typecheckers, but you should of course
   only do that after you've done the task by hand.

### Subtask 1.1

This expression is in a non-empty context.

```scala
//Typecheck
val plusOneOpen: Exp = Add("x", 1)
//In the following context:
val plusOneGamma: Map[String, Type] = Map("x" -> NumType())
//The Scala version (pretend that it is in a corresponding context)
//val plusOneScala = x + 1
```

### Subtask 1.2

These expressions are in empty contexts and focus on the core of STLC.

For `e2`, we make use of a type `BoolT`, which can be either added as primitive like `NumType()`
or defined as `SumType(JunitType(), JunitType())`.

```scala
val e1: Exp = Fun("x", NumType(), "x")
//val e1Scala = (x: Int) => x
val e2: Exp = Fun("x", BoolT, "x")
//val e2Scala = (x: Boolean) => x
val e3: Exp = Fun("x", FunType(NumType(), NumType()), "x")
//val e3Scala = (x: (Int => Int)) => x
val funPlusOne: Exp = Fun("x", FunType(NumType(), NumType()), Add("x", 1))
//val funPlusOneScala = (x: (Int => Int)) => x + 1
```


## Task 2: Let-polymorphism

Learning goal: understand concretely the additional expressivity of
[let-polymorphism](https://ps-tuebingen-courses.github.io/pl1-lecture-notes/27-type-inference/type-inference.html)
over [STLC](https://ps-tuebingen-courses.github.io/pl1-lecture-notes/26-stlc/stlc.html).

In the following expression, can you replace `???` by a type annotation that
makes it typecheck in STLC?

```scala
val exTypeInferenceSTLC =
  Let(
    "f",
    Fun("x", ???, "x"),
    Let("dummy", Ap("f", 1), Ap("f", Fun("y", NumType(), "y")))
  )
```

What about the Hindley-Milner version? Does it typecheck?

```scala
val exTypeInferenceHM =
  Let("f", Fun("x", "x"), Let("dummy", Ap("f", 1), Ap("f", Fun("y", "y"))))
```


## Task 3: Hindley-Milner type inference

Perform type inference on the following programs in
[Hindley-Milner style](https://ps-tuebingen-courses.github.io/pl1-lecture-notes/27-type-inference/type-inference.html),
i.e., write down the thus obtained types.

Note: There are no Scala versions of these programs included because Scala does not use
Hindley-Milner type inference (since it is tricky to combine with Scala's
object-oriented features).

```scala
val e1 = Fun("x", "x")
val e2 = Fun("x", Add("x", 1))

//This term is in an open context.
val e3: Exp = Add("x", 1)
val e3Ctx = Map("x" -> freshTypeVar)

val apply: Exp = Fun("f", Fun("x", Ap("f", "x")))
val compose: Exp = Fun("f", Fun("g", Fun("x", Ap("g", Ap("f", "x")))))
```
